# Reach UI TODO

# On

1. Display other inqueue types
2. Add transfer_to_uri
3. Add conference buttons
4. Make UI refreshable (e.g. reload window and reconnect to the same state)

# Good to have

1. Make certain components more abstract, inheritance maybe
2. Have a config as a separate file (apart from web-pack)
3. Make it gzipped for production
4. Maybe cache certain lists (release codes)

# Done

1. Initial project, basic message flow.
2. Provide admin interface to view/edit/delete entites (agents, queues, clients, release codes, whatever)
3. group/profile selector in agent/queue
4. Display incoming call data
