# Reach UI TODO

# On

1. Display other inqueue types
2. Make UI refreshable (e.g. reload window and reconnect to the same state)
3. Make table views to remember column ordering
4. Make Transfer/Conference drop-down list updated
 
# Good to have

1. Make certain components more abstract, inheritance maybe
3. Make it gzipped for production
4. Maybe cache certain data (release codes)

# Done

3. Fix time counter on incoming call on actions like requeue
2. Have a config as a separate file (apart from web-pack)
2. Add transfer_to_uri
3. Add conference buttons
1. Initial project, basic message flow.
2. Provide admin interface to view/edit/delete entites (agents, queues, clients, release codes, whatever)

4. Display incoming call data
